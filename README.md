# Customer Buying Behaviour Prediction using Neural Networks

##  Project Overview
This project implements a Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron) model to analyze customer demographics and transaction data in order to predict buying behaviour and market demand. The system helps businesses identify high-value customers, improve marketing strategies, and optimize inventory planning.

##  Problem Statement
Traditional data analysis methods struggle to capture complex, non-linear relationships in customer purchasing patterns. This project addresses this challenge by using a Neural Network model to accurately predict customer buying behaviour.

##  Objectives
- Predict customer buying behaviour
- Identify high-value customers
- Perform feature selection to improve model accuracy
- Support data-driven business decisions

##  Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Dataset: Online Retail Dataset
- Contains transactional data including quantity, price, and customer ID

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

##  Model Description
- Model: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Input Features: Total Quantity, Total Spent, Purchase Frequency
- Output: High-value customer classification

##  Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

##  Results
The model successfully classifies customers based on buying behaviour and identifies the most influential features affecting predictions.

##  Future Enhancements
- Real-time data integration
- Deep learning architectures
- Cloud deployment
- Interactive dashboards
