# Customer Buying Behaviour Prediction using Neural Networks

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron) model to analyze customer demographics and transaction data in order to predict buying behaviour and market demand. The system helps businesses identify high-value customers, improve marketing strategies, and optimize inventory planning.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Traditional data analysis methods struggle to capture complex, non-linear relationships in customer purchasing patterns. This project addresses this challenge by using a Neural Network model to accurately predict customer buying behaviour.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict customer buying behaviour
- Identify high-value customers
- Perform feature selection to improve model accuracy
- Support data-driven business decisions

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Dataset: Online Retail Dataset
- Contains transactional data including quantity, price, and customer ID

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ⚙️ Model Description
- Model: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Input Features: Total Quantity, Total Spent, Purchase Frequency
- Output: High-value customer classification

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results
The model successfully classifies customers based on buying behaviour and identifies the most influential features affecting predictions.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Real-time data integration
- Deep learning architectures
- Cloud deployment
- Interactive dashboards
